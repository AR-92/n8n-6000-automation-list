# n8n Automation Workflows Collection

This repository contains a collection of automation workflows for n8n, organized by category.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

This repository was originally created to house a large collection of n8n workflow files. However, many of these files contained sensitive API keys and credentials that are not suitable for public distribution without careful review and sanitization.

For security reasons, we have not pushed the actual workflow files to this public repository. Instead, we're providing this README with information about what this collection would typically contain and security recommendations.

2. Use environment variables for sensitive data
3. Review all workflows carefully before importing them into your n8n instance
4. Never commit sensitive credentials to version control systems
5. Regularly audit your workflows for hardcoded secrets
